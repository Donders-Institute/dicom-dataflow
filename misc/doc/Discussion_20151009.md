- participants: Rene, Hong, Marcel, Robert

- Subject and session will be specified at the time of lab booking.
    - an extra field for specifying subject and session is needed on the lab-booking form, and the input will be part of the attributes of the booking.
    - Subjects and sessions have been used in the past for lab booking (excluding the ones being cancelled) are forbidden for new booking. 

- Tentative mapping between subject/session to DICOM worklist attributes.  A minimum worklist DICOM dump is

    where

    - `PatientName` is the subject identifier 
    - `PatientID` is a combination of the project identifier and subject identifier 
    - `PatientBirthday`, `PatientSex`, `RequestingPhysician` and `ScheduledProcedureStepPerformancePhysician` are unknown or null values. 
    - `RequestedProcedureID` is the project identifier
    - `RequestedProcedureDescription` is the project title with urlencoding for special characters 
    - `RequestedProcedureStepID` is the session identifier

## Actions

- Rene: looks up the Project database, insert the selection of subject+session on the lab-booking form.

- Hong and Marcel: check if the proposed worklist fields work on three MRI scanners.
